This time I created a new map and loaded it at 0, 0 in the end. I saw my first end city when I was at -2053, -2138. When I started moving towards the city, I flew to -2458, -2181. Then I marked it. After that I flew to -2821, -2179. I was 2 squares to the right on the minimap. Is that correct? It seems like it only starts tracking the map when you mark your first city. Is this a UI thing or is there an error?
